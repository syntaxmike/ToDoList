# ToDoList


Using the To Do list app from my Github, add the following features:

4pts The ability to mark a to do as done (a checkbox, or color in the list items for display) -- COMPLETED

6pts A category field where user selects from 4 preset categories using a Spinner (see https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/controls/spinner.html for details on how to implement) -- COMPLETED

6pts The ability to show only items from the category selected (this control should be in the main activity's menu. The default will be to show all the items) -- COMPLETED

4pts Include comments for all the changes and additions you make to the software explaining in detail what you are doing. -- COMPLETED

Extra Credit (up to 5pts) Make a beautiful UI -- COMPLETED

You will need to change the schema for the database, but you shouldn't need more than one table. You will also have to implement new query functions.
